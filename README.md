# VS Code Portfolio Theme 💻🎨

Welcome to the **VS Code Portfolio** repository! This project was developed as part of my personal branding as a Software Engineering student. The goal of this website is to showcase my skills and projects in a creative way, simulating the environment where developers spend most of their time: the IDE.

> **Note:** This code was created for creative and study purposes. It likely contains some CSS hacks, some magic numbers, and similar issues. I relied on creativity, documentation, and a bit of my own madness to build this interface. **When I made this only I and God knew what I did, now only God knows xD.** Feel free to make relevant changes and improvements!

## 📋 About the Project

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) portfolio designed to mimic the **Visual Studio Code** interface. Instead of a standard scrollable page, users navigate through "files" in the explorer to view my skills, projects, and contact info. It uses HTML and CSS to simulate code syntax highlighting, providing an immersive experience for other developers.

### Key Features (Implemented)
*   **🔍 IDE Simulation:** A realistic layout featuring a Sidebar, File Explorer, Tab System, and Editor Area.
*   **🎨 Syntax Highlighting:** CSS classes manually crafted to look like C#, Python, C++, and JSON code.
*   **📱 Fully Responsive:** Adapts from a full desktop IDE view to a mobile-friendly tabbed interface.
*   **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** Automatically detects the user's browser language to switch between English and Portuguese (PT-BR).
*   **✨ Visual Effects:** Includes a neural network particle background (Canvas), typewriter effects, and 3D tilt interactions on project cards.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies and libraries:

*   **Structure:** HTML5 (Semantic)
*   **Styling:** CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables, Media Queries)
*   **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+, DOM Manipulation)
*   **Icons:** FontAwesome
*   **Fonts:** Fira Code & JetBrains Mono (Google Fonts)
*   **Effects:** Vanilla-Tilt.js (3D Hover Effects)

## ⚙️ How to Run

Since this is a static website, you don't need a backend server or complex installation. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
*   A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
*   (Optional) VS Code with "Live Server" extension for better testing.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SHOUTEDI/Portfolio-Site
    ```

2.  **Enter the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Portfolio-Site
    ```

3.  **Run the project:**
    *   Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
    *   **OR** if using VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

## 📚 Learnings

As a Software Engineering student, this project allowed me to practice:

*   **Advanced CSS Layouts:** Mastering Flexbox and Grid to create complex application interfaces.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** Handling tab switching and dynamic content rendering without frameworks.
*   **Canvas API:** Creating performant background animations with JavaScript.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapting a complex desktop UI to work seamlessly on mobile devices.
*   **UX/UI for Developers:** Designing an interface that feels familiar and intuitive to the target audience.
